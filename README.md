# Branches

The branches in this repository represent the different iterations of our game.
Here's a rough description of the features implemented in each branch

main - Most basic version of the game with 3 lanes and a single pointer controlled by two players
5-lanes - Same as main but with 5 lanes instead of 3
reversal - Same as 5-lanes but with the addition of blue notes that flip the direction of player movement when caught
reversal-3-lanes - reversal but with only 3 lanes
